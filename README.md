# Don't Trip Over Your Trip
## A More Localized, Personalized Recommendation Engine for Travelers
*Berkeley School of Information capstone project*

Finding the right restaurant, bar, or other amenities in an unfamiliar location can be stressful. Vacationers typically have one or two major attractions in mind that draws them to a location, and while these play an important anchoring role in vacation planning, travelers must plan significant time outside of these seminal experiences. The process of planning a vacation is often laborious and stressful, and using traditional search results - from Yelp, Google, Bing, and the like - you risk of missing truly incredible local experiences just off the well-worn path.

The project is structered into the following parts:
 * `Data`: A curated subset of the Yelp academic dataset.
 * `EDA`: Notebooks displaying some of the exploratory data analysis.
 * `FeatureEngineering`: A set of models including Matrix Factorization, LightFM, DeepFM.
